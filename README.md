### Install board library for Arduino IDE
The library can be found [here](https://github.com/BSFrance/BSFrance-avr).

```bash
cd ~/Arduino/hardware
git clone https://github.com/BSFrance/BSFrance-avr
```

### Install LoRa library for Arduino IDE
LoRa RF module can be programmed using the [Arduino LoRa library](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa).

```bash
cd ~/Arduino/libraries
git clone https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa
```
